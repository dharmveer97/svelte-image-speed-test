# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Gallery.svelte component to showcase multiple image optimization techniques using SvelteKit's best practices. The gallery will demonstrate various methods including @sveltejs/enhanced-img, Vite's built-in handling, CDN optimization, and responsive image techniques with proper titles and organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see different image optimization methods clearly demonstrated, so that I can understand and implement the best approach for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the gallery loads THEN the system SHALL display images using at least 4 different optimization methods
2. WHEN each optimization method is used THEN the system SHALL display a clear title indicating the method being demonstrated
3. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL show proper responsive behavior across different screen sizes
4. IF the user views the gallery THEN the system SHALL demonstrate @sveltejs/enhanced-img, Vite asset handling, CDN optimization, and responsive picture elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want images to load efficiently with proper optimization, so that the page loads quickly and provides a good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images load THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading for non-critical images
2. WHEN modern browsers access the site THEN the system SHALL serve AVIF and WebP formats when supported
3. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL prevent layout shift by reserving proper space
4. IF the user is on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL serve appropriately sized images for the viewport

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see proper implementation of sizes and srcset attributes, so that I can understand responsive image best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large images are displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper sizes attributes for responsive loading
2. WHEN images are served THEN the system SHALL generate multiple sizes for different device types
3. WHEN the gallery displays hero-style images THEN the system SHALL use fetchpriority="high" for above-the-fold content
4. IF images are decorative THEN the system SHALL use appropriate loading strategies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a variety of images with proper accessibility, so that the gallery is inclusive and informative.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL include descriptive alt text for all images
2. WHEN the gallery loads THEN the system SHALL display at least 15-20 images to demonstrate scalability
3. WHEN images are organized THEN the system SHALL group them by optimization method with clear section headers
4. IF images fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallbacks and error handling
